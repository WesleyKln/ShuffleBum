Here is a simple tool I've made with **JavaScript** and **Discogs' API** that let you automatically find an album to listen to from your entire Discogs collection. 

This web app use the entire records saved in user's Discogs collection then shuffle them to show you only one of them. **ShuffleBum** start to retrieve data from the user's collection from the first click to ensure retrieving data as fast as possible. And so, user can ask to **ShuffleBum** a random album really quickly (when the random button from the app is up).

####  Warning :

To be used, this tool must need this two conditions :

 - [ ] ***Discogs' Username*** with at least 1 item in his collection
 - [ ] The ownerâ€™s collection must be ***public*** 

### Installation :
- Open terminal, go to the root of a new folder and launch this command :  `git clone https://github.com/WesleyKln/ShuffleBum.git .`
- Open *index.html* from folder.
- Follow the in-app's instructions.

Have fun with **ShuffleBum** !
