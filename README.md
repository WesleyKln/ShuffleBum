Here is a simple tool I've made with **JavaScript** and **Discogs' API** that let you automatically find an album to listen to from your Discogs collection. 

This web app use the first 50 items saved in user's Discogs collection then shuffle them to show you only one of them.

#### Warning :
To be used, this tool must need a ***Discogs' Username*** and the ownerâ€™s collection must be ***public*** !

### Installation
- Open terminal, go to the root of a new folder and launch this command :  `git clone https://github.com/WesleyKln/VirtualMachineCreator.git .`
- Open *index.html* from folder.
- Follow the instructions.

Have fun with **ShuffleBum** !
